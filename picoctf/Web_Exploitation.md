# Web Exploitation
## Challenge 1: cookies
On clicking the link in the challenge description, the following website was opened.

I opened the inspect  elements, went to networks and then check. Then I entered snickerdoodle as it was suggested in the searchbox.

In check, the cookie was set to name=0. I clicked on the home option and tried entering names of other cookies. Typing gingerbread gave the following result:

Now cookie was set to name=23. I then went to burpsuite, opened a browser and entered the url. I then turned the intercept ON typed gingerbread again and got the request which I sent to repeater.

## Challenge 2: SOAP
This challenge required us to read the /etc/passwd file. I clicked on the start instance option and opened the web portal. 
<img width="1265" alt="University" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68258c3f-ca2c-4913-b40e-3592173638a0">


On clicking ‘details’ button on the website, ‘Special Info::: Created By security and privacy experts’ was displayed. This could be used to read the /etc/asswd file.

On this tab, I went to developer tools to view the website’s source code.
<img width="652" alt="Sources" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f3b893-bda7-4bba-a371-190475892dd5">

I went to the Sources and noticed two files named detailsCheck.js and XmlDetailsCheckPayload.js in the js (javascript) folder.

In the function payload, there is an xml declaration. 
In order to exploit the xml vulnerability, I installed BurpSuite. On the browser opened by blurpsuite, I entered the url to the saturn.picoctf site and the request was intercepted by blurpsuite.

I then clicked on the hamburger icon in the Request tab and selected the `send to repeater` option to make changes in the xml input and test them. Then, I went back to the site, and clicked on the Details button. In order to view the request payload, I opened Network, clicked on data followed by Payload. This was the request payload: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><data><ID>1</ID></data>`

Then, on BurpSuite I injected the following XXE payload Into the request.
```<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8”?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM 
"file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<data><ID>&xxe;</ID></data>
```


-New Concepts
  1. I came across xxe vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. 


-Errors
1. While injecting the XXE payload to read the /etc/passwd file, I typed `<data><ID>1</ID></data>` instead of `<data><ID>&xxe;</ID></data>` 
2. I was confused as to why there was no response to a request I sent. This was because the instance time had run out and I had to restart it and then edit the
