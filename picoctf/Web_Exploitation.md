# Web Exploitation
## Challenge 1: cookies
On clicking the link in the challenge description, the following website was opened.

I opened the inspect element, went to networks and then check. Then I entered snickerdoodle as it was suggested in the searchbox.

In check, the cookie was set to name=0. I clicked on the home option and tried entering names of other cookies. Typing gingerbread gave the following result:

Now cookie was set to name=23. I then went to burpsuite, opened a browser and entered the url. I opened the inspect command again, entered gingerbread in the searchbox and copied the request url for check in networks. I turned On the intercept and entered the request url on a new tab on the opened browser.

I sent this request to repeater and tried changing the name value a few times to see the different cookie names.

Then I sent the request to the intruder for an attack. I set the payload position at the value of name and set the payload type to number. Then I set the number range form -1 to 25 and started the attack.

The length at the 18th payload seemed unusual. So I changed the name value to 18 and got the following response:

The flag was given.

-New concepts
1. I learned how to use the intruder to attack a website.

## Challenge 2: Forbidden Paths

This challenge required us to read the flag located in /flag.txt. The absolute path for the website files to live in is /usr/share/nginx/html/. I opened the website.

Typing /flag.txt in the filename box gave the following output as the website was filtering absolute file paths.

Typing ./flag.txt gave the following output:

So I decided to try out ../../../flag.txt which is a relative path but is the same as /flag.txt. This step yielded the flag.
